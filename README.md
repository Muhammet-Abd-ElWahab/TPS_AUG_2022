### Useless 

[Classification ➡️ Comparing Different Algorithms | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/azminetoushikwasi/classification-comparing-different-algorithms)

very general - the author tried this on multiple competitions. The code is minimal and I didn't like the quality of the theoretical info he has delivered. 

[Advanced Feature Engineering for Classification | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/azminetoushikwasi/advanced-feature-engineering-for-classification) 

same author as above. Poor quality 



### partly useful

[TPS Aug 22 - Failure Prediction | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samuelcortinhas/tps-aug-22-failure-prediction)
