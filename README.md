[Classification ➡️ Comparing Different Algorithms | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/azminetoushikwasi/classification-comparing-different-algorithms)

[Advanced Feature Engineering for Classification | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/azminetoushikwasi/advanced-feature-engineering-for-classification) 

same author as above. Poor quality
